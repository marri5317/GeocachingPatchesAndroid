# GeocachingPatchesAndroid
Repository that stores patches and tweaks for the Geocaching app for Android

## Getting started
First of all you'll need a copy of the `base.apk` from the Geocaching app. You can get one by either installing the app on your smartphone and then pulling it from `/data/app/com.groundspeak.geocaching.intro-2/base.apk` (requires root) or you can download it from this repository or other mirrors.
